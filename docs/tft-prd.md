# Product Requirements Document (PRD): ThoughtForThought

**Product Name:** ThoughtForThought  
**Prepared By:** Thom Franklin  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 20, 2025

---

## 1. Purpose

ThoughtForThought is a real-time, voice-based translation application designed for natural, thought-level conversation between speakers of different languages. Unlike conventional word-for-word translators, ThoughtForThought listens for a complete idea, identifies a natural pause (using the proprietary Human Timing Engine™), then translates the meaning, tone, and nuance into the listener's language.

---

## 2. Background & Motivation

Existing translation tools interrupt speakers, mistranslate emotionally rich content, and often lose the context of natural speech. ThoughtForThought is designed to serve:

- Multilingual couples  
- Expats and travelers  
- Therapists and coaches  
- Hospital and caregiving environments  
- International professionals  

The product relies on:

- GPT-4o for context-aware translation  
- Whisper or Apple STT for transcription  
- A proprietary Human Timing Engine™ for natural pause detection  

A provisional patent has been filed under the name:  
**Pause-Based, Intent-Aware Language Translation Method**

## 3. Features & Requirements

### 3.1 Core Features

- **Continuous Listening**: App listens continuously, detecting thoughts through speech energy and pause detection.  
- **Pause-Based Segmentation**: A pause (~1.8–2.2s) + drop in speech energy marks a segment.  
- **Speech-to-Text**: Transcribes segment using Whisper or Apple STT.  
- **Contextual Translation**: Translates entire segment using GPT-4o with retained tone and nuance.  
- **Natural Voice Output**: Synthesizes translated speech using warm, natural TTS or GPT voice.  
- **Language Pairing**: Set two active languages at start; app auto-detects which is being spoken.  
- **Command Recognition**: Recognizes user voice commands:  
  - “Change language”  
  - “Reverse direction”  
  - “Pause” / “Resume”  

### 3.2 Optional Features (Pro / Future Releases)

- Delay toggle for output  
- Emotion-sensitive translation modes  
- Whisper fallback or dual STT engine comparison  
- Speaker voice cloning  
- Conversation transcript export  

---

## 4. User Stories

- **As a multilingual couple**, I want the app to wait until my partner finishes their thought,  
  _so that_ I can understand the full meaning and not get confused by mid-sentence translations.

- **As a hospital staff member**, I want to translate caregiver instructions accurately,  
  _so that_ the patient understands the meaning and emotion without fear or confusion.

- **As a traveler**, I want to hear translated speech naturally and slowly,  
  _so that_ I can reply without feeling rushed or misinformed.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### Frontend

- Cross-platform app (PWA / iOS / Android)  
- Clean UI with two modes: Conversation and Settings  
- Language flags and mic indicators  

### Backend

- Whisper/Apple STT integration  
- GPT-4o translation call with custom prompt  
- TTS (Google WaveNet, ElevenLabs, or GPT Voice)  
- Human Timing Engine for pause detection  
- Real-time voice buffer for streaming  

### Trigger Mechanism

- Optionally use trigger word (e.g., “Kiki”) during training phase  
- Then default to pause + energy detection  
- Learn user-specific pause timing over time

## 6. Patent Requirements Alignment

This product implements:

- A pause-based signal detection system  
- Context-aware segment translation  
- A non-interruptive conversational flow  
- Emotionally sensitive rendering of translated speech  

Protected by provisional patent filed under:  
**“Pause-Based, Intent-Aware Language Translation Method”**

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

- **Latency**: Optimize STT and TTS, use caching  
- **Accuracy**: Fine-tune GPT-4o prompts per language pair  
- **Privacy**: Implement local processing for sensitive speech  
- **IP Theft**: Use NDAs and rapid patent continuation  

---
